# ABCJS demo

## Background
While I have used desktop apps for music notation (for decades), I had kept an eye out for a tool that was cross-platform and potentially collaborative.


As we revise application code, [government policy](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/how-i-changed-the-law-with-a-github-pull-request/), etc. 
using source control tools, I have wondered -- licensing issues aside -- why it's not popular to collaboratively revise music.

I came across the [abc notation standard](http://www.abcnotation.org.uk/) a few years ago, but only recently decided to revisit the framework to give this Lightning Talk.

The most comprehensive resource I could find is here:
